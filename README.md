- 👋 Hi, I’m Morten Winther Olsson (@olwimo)
- 👀 I’m interested in all kinds of programming, but have a special affection for declarative (mostly functional and esp. logic) style/languages (❤Haskell❤, 💘Prolog💘)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning tensorflow and nodejs/webpack/react
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything fun/impossible/poetic
- 📫 If you want to reach out to me, I prefer you do so through a PR with changes/additions to one of my public repos
